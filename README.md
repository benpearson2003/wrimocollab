# WriMoCollab

A system to encourage and gamify collaborative writing.

1. Login
2. Create or join a project
- create project: add existing users or invite and set word goal
3. Write n words every 24 hours where n = words remaining / days remaining / number of writers
- failure to meet goal drops user from project, decrementing the number of writers and making the project harder to complete

## Usage

Optimized to be deployed from GitHub to Heroku. Enable the Heroku Postgres database addon.
