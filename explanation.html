<h1>I used to play a game...</h1>
<p>In 2007, I played a game called War of Nations. Working with a team, I would capture villages, improve them, build up their defenses,
and expand my team's territory. Through suspect treaties with the other teams, we'd negotiate ourselves away from fighting on multiple
fronts. Working together, taking advantage of terrain, and securing key points would build and release tension on the map and eventually
reveal a winner. To my dismay, the creator of that game walked away and took his work with him.</p>
<h2>What to do?</h2>
<p>Years later, I now have the skills to recreate War of Nations. Using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, I pieced together the tools
the old creator used. This new decade has given me access to new tools such as more affordable hosting, accessible documentation, and
source control that allows me to work in my free time on any computer. Since starting this project on July 25, 2018, I have learned
how to use new tools and created this rough sketch of what that game once was. By Winter, I hope to have version 1.0 with all the major
features of the old War of Nations.</p>
<h2>What's coming?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>directly attacking enemy flocks</li>
    <li>clan capitols will need to be taken by siege, unlike other villages</li>
    <li>constructing village improvements such as walls</li>
    <li>merchant units and markets</li>
    <li>improved casualty calculation</li>
    <li>in game messaging that will record battles from the past week and communication between players</li>
    <li>win state: 40% land ownership or 3 capitols conquered (new map will be generated)</li>
</ul>
